In the Fate/Zero Drama CD, she was born out of love between Kiritsugu and Irisviel, to be Kiritsugu's reason for living when he comes back from the war.  The head of the family Jubstacheit von Einzbern, however, anticipated the possibility that Kiritsugu and Irisviel would fail to win the Fourth Holy Grail War, so he allowed Illyasviel to be born with modifications to allow her to become the Holy Grail should a Fifth Holy Grail War occur.

Illya's personal interest in Shirou is conflicted due to the fact that Kiritsugu, whom she loved for he was her father, remained in Japan as Shirou's adoptive father after betraying her family by destroying the long-sought Grail. She feels that Kiritsugu abandoned her for Shirou, and is jealous of Shirou for that. When she first meets Shirou, she considers him as something of an older brother.  Though he is distrustful of her at first, he comes to like Illya, seeing her as a little sister. However at the same time, she also feels very close to Shirou for his relationship with Kiritsugu. As such, she becomes very affectionate and clingy towards him (like a younger sibling would) when Berserker is defeated, much to Saber and Rin's annoyance.

Despite her growth in maturity, she still holds behaviors fitting of her age such as childish tempers, trying to act mature, and being stubborn towards things she dislikes.
